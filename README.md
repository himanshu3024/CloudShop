# CloudShop E-Commerce Website

## Project Idea

CloudShop is a modern, cloud-native e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless, interactive, and dynamic shopping experience. Built with cutting-edge web technologies and deployed on Microsoft Azure, CloudShop aims to deliver a scalable, secure, and user-friendly online store. The platform features a responsive frontend, a robust backend with RESTful APIs, and a cloud-hosted database, making it ideal for businesses seeking a professional and efficient e-commerce solution. The project showcases best practices in web development, cloud integration, and modular design, targeting a production-ready application that can handle real-world e-commerce demands.

## Status

**Under Construction**: CloudShop is currently in development, with the initial phase (Part 1) focusing on establishing the frontend HTML structure. Subsequent parts will introduce React for interactivity, a Node.js/Express backend, Azure Cosmos DB for data storage, and full cloud deployment on Azure. The project is divided into 10 parts for modular development, ensuring a clear and organized progression.

## Project Scope

CloudShop will be developed in 10 parts, each building on the previous to create a fully functional e-commerce platform. The scope includes:

1. **Frontend Foundation** (Current Focus):
   - Create a semantic HTML structure for the homepage with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
   - Set up a project structure optimized for React integration and Azure deployment.
   - Features: Sticky navbar, hero section, featured products placeholder, and footer.

2. **Product Listing Page**:
   - Implement a dynamic product catalog using React with filtering and sorting capabilities.
   - Features: Grid-based product display, category filters, and search functionality.

3. **Product Details and Cart**:
   - Build product detail pages and a shopping cart with state management (e.g., Redux or React Context).
   - Features: Product descriptions, image galleries, and cart persistence.

4. **User Authentication (Frontend)**:
   - Develop login and registration UI with form validation and error handling.
   - Features: Responsive forms, secure input handling, and user feedback.

5. **Backend Setup**:
   - Set up a Node.js/Express server with RESTful API routes.
   - Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for scalable data storage.
   - Features: API endpoints for products and user management.

6. **Authentication Backend**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user login and registration.
   - Integrate with Azure services for enhanced security (e.g., Azure Active Directory).
   - Features: Token-based authentication, password hashing, and session management.

7. **Product and Cart APIs**:
   - Create APIs for product CRUD operations and cart management.
   - Features: Scalable data retrieval, cart updates, and inventory tracking.

8. **Payment Integration**:
   - Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for secure transactions.
   - Features: Checkout flow, payment processing, and order confirmation.

9. **Azure Deployment**:
   - Deploy the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps or App Service.
   - Host the backend and APIs on Azure App Service.
   - Configure Azure Cosmos DB for production-grade database operations.
   - Features: CI/CD with Azure Pipelines, scalability, and monitoring.

10. **Final Touches and Optimization**:
    - Add advanced features like search, error handling, and performance optimizations.
    - Implement testing (unit and integration) and analytics.
    - Features: SEO optimization, accessibility improvements, and user analytics.

## Current Progress (Part 1)

### Description

Part 1 focuses on the frontend HTML structure for the CloudShop homepage. The layout is built with semantic HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a modern, responsive design. The structure is designed to integrate seamlessly with React for dynamic functionality and Azure for cloud deployment.

### Files

- `public/index.html`: Semantic HTML with Tailwind CSS classes for the homepage layout.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

### Features

- **Semantic Markup**: Uses `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` for accessibility and SEO.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures a mobile-first layout with grid and flex utilities.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Lightweight structure optimized for Azure App Service or Static Web Apps.
- **Professional Design**: Modern gradient hero, sticky navbar, and clean typography to impress stakeholders.

### Setup Instructions

1. Place `index.html` in the `public/` directory.
2. Serve locally using a web server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   cd public
   http-server
